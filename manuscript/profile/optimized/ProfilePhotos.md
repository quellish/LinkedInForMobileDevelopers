## Profile Photos {#profile-photos}

Not having a profile photo is not the end of the world, but it is better to have one than not. When you appear in search results not having a photo will tend to make people bypass your profile. A profile photo is worth investing some time into.

I highly recommend [PhotoFeeler](https://www.photofeeler.com) for choosing which photo of yourself to use. Pick a few photos of yourself and use their service to test them. Their [blog](https://blog.photofeeler.com) has some great articles on shooting and choosing profile photos for LinkedIn.

Read through their guidelines and take a few photos. Use their service to test which photos perform best. Pick the best performer and set that as your photo.

Want to take it to the next level? Hire a professional photographer. [Snappr] (https://www.snappr.co/) is a service that can help you do that. They also have a [LinkedIn Photo Analyzer tool](https://www.snappr.co/photo-analyzer/) that can give you some input on your photo. Be warned though that this tool uses machine learning and can sometimes get things [very wrong](https://blog.photofeeler.com/snappr-photo-analyzer/).
