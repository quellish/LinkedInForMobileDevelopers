## Connections {#connections}

Look up people you have worked with in the past. Start by looking over the work experience you have listed on your profile. For each job, who in that company comes to mind first? Connect with them on LinkedIn.

You can also add people you know from places like Reddit, StackOverflow, or blogs you follow. When you connect with them write a short message introducing yourself.

[Socilab](http://socilab.com/#home) is a tool for visualizing your LinkedIn connections graph.

As your connections grow it can be a useful tool for seeing the big picture of how your network is changing.
