-# Your Profile {#your-profile}

# Overview

Your profile is your identity. It is how you present yourself to collegues and employers. 

[TODO]: # (Anthony's empty profile)

Your profile is also what recruiters and potential employers see before even talking to you. It is the landing page for your professional life - and with little effort it can stand out and attract the interest that benefits you.

W> ## Profile Change Notifications {#profile-notifications}
W> Have you ever gotten an email from LinkedIn about one of your former coworkers changing a job? 
W> LinkedIn will notify all of your connections when anything on your profile changes. It is important to *disable* profile change notifications before starting any edits on your profile. Otherwise all of your connections will get spammed with each change you make.

W> [LinkedIn maintains a support document that outlines how to disable these notifications.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/86236/sharing-profile-changes-with-your-network)

W> When you are done making changes you can enable the notifications again.

W> ## Backing Up Your Profile {#profile-backups}
W> Before you start making changes to your profile it is a good idea to make a backup.
W> To back up your LinkedIn data request a data export from the [Member Data](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/member-data) page. LinkedIn will email you a download link shortly after you request an export. Exporting profiles, connections and recommendations is generally quick. Larger exports can take much longer - a large export every few months is not a bad idea.
