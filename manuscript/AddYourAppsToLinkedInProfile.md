## Add Apps and Projects to Your Profile {#add-apps}


### Adding Projects {#adding-projects}

LinkedIn profiles can list projects you have worked on. This can be great for showing the applications and open source projects you have contributed to. 

To add a project to your profile go to “Add new profile section…” in the upper right of your profile page.

Scroll down to “Accomplishments” and click on “Projects”. This will open a dialog box for adding a new project.

For an open source project enter a link to the project home page or repository. Even better, link to your specific contributions. 

For an application that is available on the iTunes app store use a link from iTunes Link Maker.  For an Android application you will need a Google Play deep link.

#### iTunes Link Maker

Look up the app using 
[iTunes Link Maker](https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/en-us) 

![iTunes Link Maker Search Page](images/linkmakerselectmediatype.png)
 
In the "Media Type" dropdown, select "iOS Apps" (or "macOS Apps" for the Mac App Store).
 
Search for the app by name or bundle ID. You should see a result like this:

This will give you the name, app store description, and a direct link to the download page. The direct link at the bottom of the page is what you will want for your LinkedIn profile. 

#### Google Play Links
Google provides a guide to creating deep links for the Play Store:

Describe the work you did on each project in 3 sentences or more. Use that as the description for the project.

### Adding apps to your work experience {#adding-apps-work}

If your work on this app was part of a job listed in your work experience on LinkedIn, add it there as well. Scroll to that job in the work experience section of your profile. Edit the experience information by clicking on the edit (pencil) icon. In the dialog box that is presented there, scroll down to “Media” and click “Link”.

Paste the link you generated from iTunes Link Maker or Google Play there as well.

### Adding apps to your Profile Intro {#adding-apps-intro}

Once you have done that, think about which of these projects you are most proud of. What was your best work? Scroll your profile back up to the top and click the edit (pencil) icon to the right of your photo. This will present a dialog to edit your intro. Just like editing your work experience, you can add media here. These will be some of the first things anyone viewing your profile will see - pick the three projects and add links to them.

### What If I have Nothing To Add?

#### Finding an open source project to contribute to {#finding-open-source}

Start with projects you are already familiar with.
Do your projects use any frameworks or libraries managed by CocoaPods, Carthage, or the Swift Package Manager? Look there first.

Swift is open source, as are Grand Central Dispatch and SourceKit. On the Android side OkHTTP and many other code libraries are open source. 

If you are STILL looking, try [Github's trending Objective-C repositories list](https://github.com/trending/objective-c?since=monthly) or [trending swift repositories](https://github.com/trending/swift?since=monthly).

Read through the open issues and recent mailing list messages. Look for an issue, feature, or enhancement you believe you could handle. 

If you don't see an issue that fits your skills you can always add tests. Most open source projects appreciate contributed tests. Look for areas of the the project that have poor code coverage or areas that may be the source of bugs. 

Check the project documentation for guidance on how best to contribute. Many projects have guidelines for contributors and coding standards. 

[Fork the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). Make your changes. [Submit a pull request back to the project.](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

Contributing changes to open source projects is one of the best things you can do for your career.  Imagine you are a manager looking for someone to join his Swift team. You find someone who not only knows Swift but *contributed code to it*.  Few things can top that.
