## Choosing Key Words and Phrases {#beta-profile-keywords}

Unfortunately LinkedIn does not publish any data on what people are searching for.  Having that data would be helpful but it is not necessary - you can rely on the laziness of the recruiters and hiring managers instead.

Most of the people looking for candiates to fill jobs start by searching using words from the job description. That is where you can get enough keywords to be successful. Browse LinkedIn and other job sites. You're looking for job listings that sound like they may be a good fit. Either jobs that interest you or companies that *should be looking for you*. 

Don't pay attention to requirements for degrees, years of experience or seniority. Look at the text. What words or phrases are repeated in several listings? What unique words are being used to describe the "ideal candidate"?

You will probably see things like:
`ios applications`
`objective-c`
`maintain`
`develop`
`android apps`

> *If* you wanted to take things a few steps further you could export a large number of job listings as text and analyze them. For example, a simple word frequency analysis would take only a couple of minutes but may be insightful. 
> 

Write some of those words and phrases in a text editor or note pad.  Later as you edit your profile further you want to keep them in mind. Incorportate those and similar words into your writing.

## Update Your Job Titles {#beta-profile-job-titles}

LinkedIn places special importance on job titles when computing search relevance.  If you want to be found when someone searches for "ios developer" make sure at least some of your job titles incorporate those words - even if your official job description did not match that.

There are many ways to do this. Let's say your actual title was "Software Engineer". The title you use in the relevant work experience on your profile may be "Sofware Engineer, iOS Developer"
Or "Software Engineer, iOS Developer using Swift"
Or just "iOS Developer".
It is fine to be creative as long as you are still being honest. Obviously don't change a junior engineer title into a senior.

## Update Your Descriptions {#beta-profile-job-descriptions}

Now give the detailed descriptions in your work experience a look. Chances are you could change some of the wording to use key words and phrases on your list. Descriptions are not as important as titles for relevance but they are still useful. Take a few minutes to edit the descriptions to use more of those key words.
