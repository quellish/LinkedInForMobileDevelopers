# Profile Photos

Not having a profile photo is not the end of the world, but it is better to have one than not. 

I highly recommend [PhotoFeeler](https://www.photofeeler.com) for choosing which photo of yourself to use. Pick a few photos of yourself and use their service to test them. Their [blog](https://blog.photofeeler.com) has some great articles on shooting and choosing profile photos for LinkedIn.
