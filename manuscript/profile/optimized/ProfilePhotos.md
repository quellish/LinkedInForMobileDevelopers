## Profile Photos {#profile-photos}

Not having a profile photo is not the end of the world, but it is better to have one than not. When you appear in search results not having a photo will tend to make people bypass your profile. A profile photo is worth investing some time into.

I highly recommend [PhotoFeeler](https://www.photofeeler.com) for choosing which photo of yourself to use. Pick a few photos of yourself and use their service to test them. Their [blog](https://blog.photofeeler.com) has some great articles on shooting and choosing profile photos for LinkedIn.

Read through their guidelines and take a few photos. Use their service to test which photos perform best. Pick the best performer and set that as your photo.

Here are a few quick tips for choosing or taking a profile photo:

- Smile. Don't use a photo with a neutral or negative expression.
- Look at the camera. Make sure you're making eye contact with the viewer.
- Don't slouch. You don't want to look too relaxed or sloppy.
- Use a flat background and natural light. A white wall near a window can be ideal.
- If at all possible don't use a "selfie". Have someone help you take the photos. If you can't get help, use a tripod or other stable mount. If you happen to have an Apple Watch that can be an excellent remote control for the iPhone camera. 
- Take the photo from slightly below eye level looking up at you. 

Want to take it to the next level? Hire a professional photographer. [Snappr] (https://www.snappr.co/) is a service that can help you do that. They also have a [LinkedIn Photo Analyzer tool](https://www.snappr.co/photo-analyzer/) that can give you some input on your photo. Be warned though that this tool uses machine learning and can sometimes get things [very wrong](https://blog.photofeeler.com/snappr-photo-analyzer/).
