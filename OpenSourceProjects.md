# Open Source Projects

## Contributing to open source projects

### Finding a project to contribute to

Look at some of the tools and libraries you use every day. It is a safe bet that at least one of them is open source and written in a language you can understand. Find the public project repository using Google. 

If you do not find anything there, try looking at [Github's trending Objective-C repositories list](https://github.com/trending/objective-c?since=monthly) or [trending swift repositories](https://github.com/trending/swift?since=monthly).

Fork it.

Look through the issues for the project on github. Fix one.

Think you are not up to that challenge? Add a new unit test instead. Unit tests are a skill that employers look for and most open source projects need more tests. Tests are easy to write and often very welcome by maintainers.
