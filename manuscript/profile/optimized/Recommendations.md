## Recommendations {#recommendations}
Provide recommendations for your connections
***Average Completion Time: 20 minutes***

Checklist:

- [ ] Write a recommendation for at least 3 of your connections

Look up the person you want to recommend. You should be connected to them on LinkedIn *before* you recommend them. So if you aren't connected, connect to them first.

On their profile page click "More..." and select "Recommend"

Sometimes writing a recommendation flows out of you into the keyboard. And sometimes the tiny, empty text field seems to be sitting there mocking you. 

For those times you can use a recommendation generator as a starting point.

[Here is one](http://linkedin.bitshare.cm/recommendations.php)

Some time *after* you write a recommendation check LinkedIn to see if they have recommended you back. If they have not, you can request a recommendation from them.
