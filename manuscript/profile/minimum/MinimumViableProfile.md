## Getting Started {#minimum-viable-profile-getting-started}
While you work on your profile, it is a good idea to have a note pad or text editor handy. When you run into a speed bump like not being able to remember what dates you were at a job, make a note of it and move on. You will be coming back later to optimize your profile further - notes will have you better prepared.

## Set Your Location {#minimum-viable-profile-location}
Set your location using the name of the town or city you are located in. You can also use the zip code in the US.
Location settings can be changed by going to "Settings and Privacy":

...then "Site Preferences":

 This will actually take you back to "Edit Intro" on your profile, which is where you can make the other changes in this section as well.

## Set an Industry {#minimum-viable-profile-industry}
For readers of this book this should be "Computer Software". At least as of this writing there is no specific "Mobile Software" industry listed - even though "Nanotechnology" is!

## Add Your Education {#minimum-viable-profile-education}
Easy, enter where you last went to school. Graduate school, college, or high school. LinkedIn suggests matches as you type. 
If you have attended a specialized technical school or program and *LinkedIn suggests a match*, add that as well. For example, LinkedIn recognizes some "coding bootcamps" and online courses as educational institutions.

## Enter Some Work Experience {#minimum-viable-profile-work-experience}

### Company Name
It is essential to use the company name that LinkedIn provides rather than writing it yourself. Imagine if you had three people who worked at Apple. 
One lists the company name as "Apple".
The second writes it as "Apple, Inc".
And the third uses "Apple Computer".
As far as LinkedIn would be able to tell these are three different companies! If LinkedIn provides an *accurate* name for your company while you are filling out the work experience form use it. Only write the name yourself if LinkedIn offers no suggestions that fit.

### Dates of Employment
Who can remember their first and last day at every job? Not me. I am lucky to get the year correct. Don't worry about how precise the dates are. As long as you get the year correct and the month close you should be fine. 

### Job Title
Enter anything reasonably accurate for now. We're coming back to this later for a much more detailed look. Make sure you enter a job title, but don't spend too much time on it.

### Job Description
You can leave this blank for now if you want - we're coming back to it later. 

## Add Three Skills {#minimum-viable-profile-skills}
To add a skill to your profile go to “Add new profile section…” in the upper right of your profile page. 

![Add New Profile Section](images/add-skills.png)

Scroll down to “Skills”. Click the "+" icon. This will present a dialog for entering a skill. Think about something you did or used in your last job. It could be a language (i.e. Swift, Java, Kotlin), a framework (i.e. Core Animation), a tool (i.e. Xcode, Gradle), etc. Are you the go-to guy for Core Data or table view questions? Add those. Think about what your co workers know you for. Those are the kinds of things you definitely want to add.

You should have at least 3 skills listed on your profile.

## Add a Profile Photo {#minimum-viable-profile-profile-photo}
Add a profile photo that shows *you*. Don't spend too much time choosing a photo - we will come back to this later.

## Ready!
At this point you have the minimum profile needed to get started on LinkedIn.
